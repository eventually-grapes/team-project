# Team Contract

---
## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

---
## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* We will use Discord for all communication outside of class required for the project.

* Each teammate agrees to respond to messages in at most 2 days during the week. 

* Teammates should notify each other if they're going to miss a lecture/lab and for any important progress updates.

* Respectful and inclusive behaviours should include listening to others' ideas, trying to help if someone is really stuck on something, and making sure you aren't interfering or conflicting with others' contributions.

---
## Decision Making

* Decisions will be made by majority vote after discussions to ensure everyone's ideas are fully heard first.

---
## Conflict resolution

* The team will resolve conflicts by attempting to reach agreement by discussion, going to a vote if applicable, or consulting the TA if agreement can't be reached.

---

## Accountability

* Responsibilities of each team member are to put significant effort into trying to complete their share of work, and to ask for help if it can't be completed in time for when it is required (either for a due date or for another team member's work that requires it).
